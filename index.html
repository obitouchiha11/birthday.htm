<h3>To my dearest friend,<br><br>

    Words can hardly capture the depth of what you mean to me, but I'll try my best. You are more than just a friend; you are my confidant, my partner in laughter, and the one who stands by me when life gets tough. Your kindness, strength, and unwavering support have been a constant light in my life, guiding me through every storm and celebrating with me in every joy.
    
    You have a heart that shines brighter than the sun, a spirit that is unbreakable, and a soul that understands mine in ways that words cannot explain. Thank you for being you — for every smile shared, every tear wiped away, and every moment we’ve spent together. I’m grateful for your friendship today and every day.
    
    Here's to many more adventures, endless laughter, and a lifetime of cherished memories. I couldn’t ask for a better friend than you.
    
    With all my love and gratitude,
    <p>[Amir]</p>
